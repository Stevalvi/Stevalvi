### 💼 &nbsp;Featured Projects
- [real estate](https://inmobiliaria-react-typescript.netlify.app/): Terraplén is an innovative and user-friendly web platform designed to efficiently manage and display real estate properties. It provides an intuitive experience for both users searching for properties and those looking to get in touch with the real estate agency, with a contact form that sends inquiries directly to the agency's email. Users can explore a wide range of properties with detailed information on location, price, type, and features, and use advanced filters to refine their search based on specific needs. With a modern and accessible design, Terraplén ensures smooth navigation across different devices, making the property search and inquiry process a pleasant and efficient experience anytime and anywhere.
- [expense planner](https://controldegastos-react-typescript.netlify.app/): This project is a web application that allows users to manage their budget in a simple way. Users can set an initial budget and add expenses under specific categories such as food, transportation, entertainment, and more. The application includes intuitive gestures, such as swiping left to delete an expense or swiping right to update it. The design is intended to be efficient and user-friendly, providing clear real-time tracking of expenses.
- [calorie counter](https://contadordecalorias-react-typescript.netlify.app/): This project is a CRUD application that allows users to log and manage their daily activities, whether meals or exercises. Activities are saved in localStorage and reflected in real-time on the interface. As users add foods with their consumed calories and exercises with calories burned, the application automatically calculates the difference, helping users maintain a balanced control of their calorie intake and expenditure. The interface is simple and easy to use, allowing users to create, update, or delete activities efficiently.
- [drink finder](https://bebidas-react-router-dom-typescript.netlify.app/): This project is a web application that consumes a drink API to allow users to search for ingredients and filter recipes by specific categories. The results display detailed recipes that users can add to or remove from their favorites list, which is stored in localStorage for easy future access. The interface design is intuitive, providing a fast and efficient experience for searching, discovering, and managing favorite drink recipes.
